            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>My journey into computer science began during my 1st year in college  when I was first introduced to
                programming through a basic coding class. The ability to solve complex problems and create something
                tangible from lines of code fascinated me. This early exposure sparked a deep interest in technology and
                a desire to understand the intricacies of how things work behind the scenes.</p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I pursued my passion for technology by enrolling in  Btech in the Computer Science and Engineering in specialization in Artificial intelligence and Machine learning at Lakshmi Narain College of Technology,
               As I was interested in technology stuffs from begining and i always engage myself in learning new thngs that add value in me .</p>
            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>During my time at university, I had the opportunity to intern at Prodigy InfoTech, where I worked as a
                Web Development Intern. This experience was invaluable, as I was able to apply
                my academic knowledge to real-world projects. I
                contributed to the development of many web application, and learned best practices in web development.
            </p>
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>What motivates me most about computer science is its potential to solve real-world problems and improve
                people's lives. Whether it's through developing efficient algorithms, creating user-friendly
                applications, or exploring new frontiers in AI, I am driven by the impact that technology can have on
                society, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this ever-evolving
                field.</p>
            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p>Looking ahead, I am excited to embark on a career where I can leverage my skills and experiences to
                contribute to innovative projects. I aim to work in an environment that challenges me to think
                creatively and continuously improve. My goal is to be part of a dynamic team that is dedicated to
                pushing the boundaries of what is possible with technology.</p>

                <h3>Stopwatch</h3>
                <p>For my Web Development internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I created a fully functional stopwatch
                    application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features start, pause, resume, and reset
                    functionalities for accurate time tracking. With hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds display,
                    users can precisely measure time intervals. The stopwatch's visually appealing design includes a
                    colorful background and an interactive lap feature that records lap times in a table format below
                    the stopwatch. This project showcases my proficiency in web development and my ability to create
                    user-friendly applications.</p>

                <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
                <p>My Tic Tac Toe project is a modern web-based implementation of the classic game. Developed using
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers an interactive and engaging gaming experience. Players can
                    enjoy matches against each other or challenge an AI opponent. The game tracks wins, losses, and
                    draws, providing a comprehensive gaming experience. With vibrant visuals and intuitive controls,
                    this project showcases my skills in front-end web development and game design. It's a testament to
                    my ability to create fun and interactive web applications.</p>
